# FaceCoinBot
A specialized chat-bot created in the Facebook Tel-Aviv hackathon of 2017
A cryptocurrency wallet implementation, running on a facbook page chatbot.
(the currency itself was build for the hackathon on Ethereum blockchain, the wallet is desktop based.
The chatbot server ‘hold’ a big amount of money to allow a quick transfer and avoid security issues)
Allowing technology challenged people to enjoy the cryptocurrency many advantages,  with a user-friendly and very easy to use interface.
Helping developed-countries-citizens connect financially to the world (as they don’t need to use international credit card which they can’t hold or don’t have) 
Letting people censored buy a tyranny overcome the oppressor as the currency is not held nor govern by them.
